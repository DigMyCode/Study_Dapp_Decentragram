# Study_Dapp_Decentragram
Here I'm studying to upload the images to the web-interfase (with meta-mask application), 
tip their owners, store them on IPFS and keep their attributes on the blockchain (Ganache). 
Also learned writing tests using Truffle.

* Created a smart-contract that has functions to upload images and tip their owners
* Created a backend that aloows to upload the images on the frontend and store on the IPFS 
and get their attributes from the blockchain, converting them to the frontend afterwards
* Coded a frontend to make it all usable
